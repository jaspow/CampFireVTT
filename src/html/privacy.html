            <p><em>This is the default privacy policy that comes with FreeBeeGee. The owners of this site did not yet take the time to review it, otherwise they would have deleted this paragraph and replaced all [[PLACEHOLDERS]] below. This means the following information might or might not apply in full.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Effective Date: January 1st, 2021</strong></p>

            <p>This privacy notice is based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It informs you according to Art. 13 about kind, amount and purpose of collected personal data on [[DOMAIN]], called <em>this website</em> from now on.</p>

            <h2>Imprint</h2>

            <p>This website is provided by:</p>

            <p>
              [[NAME]]<br>
              [[STREET]]<br>
              [[CITY]]<br>
              [[COUNTRY]]
            </p>

            <p>Please note that everyone can download FreeBeeGee and run a server without affiliation with the original creators of this sotware or the providers of this particular website.</p>

            <h2>Access data</h2>

            <p>With each access to this website your browser automatically transmits: Name of the file, browser and browser-version, operating system, referrer URL (the site that brought you to us) and your IP address. This information is stored together with date, time, success and amount of transferred data because of legitimate interests in server logfiles. We keep those logfiles up to [[STORAGE TIME]] to maintain operation of this website, for security measurements, for analyzing technical problems and to clarify legal issues.</p>

            <h2>Game data</h2>

            <p>Each game session is identified by an server-unique room name you choose when you create it. A room name will be visible in the URL, but is not publically listed or shared by us. However, everyone who knows that name or can guess it, can enter the room.</p>

            <p>All data in a room - the pieces, the game board and everything else on it - is stored separate from other room and other servers. Only those that have entered a particular room on a particular server can see/access that data.</p>

            <p>Rooms do not store information about the players, only the current state of its tables' layout, the pieces and its library / assets. Rooms also do not store the information mentioned above under <em>Access data</em>.</p>

            <p>All data in a room is shared with all people that enter it. Everyone in a room can download some or all this data at once (so-called snapshots) at any time.</p>

            <p>Rooms and all their data are deleted from this server after a certain period of inactivity of any table. See the information below the join screen for the actual value of this period - usually 48 hours. If everyone leaves a room and nobody enters it again for that period, it and all contained game data & assets are automatically deleted.</p>

            <p>After a room is deleted, its name is free again for others to use. However, no data is taken over from the previous room with the same name.</p>

            <h3>Snapshots</h3>

            <p>A snapshot is a .zip file containing the state of a room at a certain point in time. This includes the game setup and all assets. Those that have entered a room can download such a snapshot to their local computer at any time.</p>

            <p>While we delete rooms after a period of inactivity (see above), we can not exert any control over downloaded snapshots by their previous players. They can recreate rooms from those snapshots, either on this or any other FreeBeeGee server, by uploading them again at any time.</p>

            <h2>External services & links</h2>

            <p>This websites provides links to GitHub for easy access to binary and source code distributions of FreeBeeGee. We have to inform you that GitHub is provided by companies located outsite the EU. No personal data is shared between us and them on this website. As soon as you enter their website, their respective privacy policy applies.</p>

            <h2>Data minimization</h2>

            <p>Personal data is stored according to Art. 17 and 18 GDPR only as long as necessary, for the performance of a contract, or we are obliged by other laws to do so. We delete or anonymize data as soon as it no longer required. We have to keep general business documents for [[STORAGE TIME]] years in our country.</p>

            <h2>Hosting</h2>

We can only comply to the right of erasure if no other legal requirements require us to store the data for a longer time.</p>
